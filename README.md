# Counselor NotePad

## Application Overview

School Counselors are responsible for keeping detailed notes on students.  Therefore, Counselor Notepad (formerly BOSS), was created so that counselors can keep detailed and organized notes on a student.  This application not only allows the user to create and view notes, but updates can be made when needed and the record can easily be deleted.

## Application Approach & Design

When designing the application, user stories and wireframes were created to ensure that the app would best fit the needs of school counselors.

### User-Stories
The following is a sample of user stories that were considered in the production of the application.

1. As a user, I would like to have notes that can be easily created, viewed and updated.
2. As a user, I would like to have a dashboard where I could view, update and delete a student's record.
3. As a user, I would like existing information to be passed to an update form.
4. As a user, I would like information to be presented in a table.
5. As a user, I do not want to be limited in the amount of text included in the notes field.

### Application Limitations & Unresolved Problems

There are some limitations with this web application.  For example, records are not sorted by the last name of a student. Also, the amount of identifying information is limited.  By creating additional fields, such as student date-of-birth, school counselors would have an easier time identifying students.  Therefore, a number of improvements could be made.
